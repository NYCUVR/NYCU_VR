## About Us

We are a group of students from National Yang Ming Jiaotong University. The team includes members from various departments with various skills. At first, in 2008, in an era when students' car-making was not yet popular, the NVR Bamboo and Fox Cars of Jiaotong University was formally established by linking the passion of car-loving and car-making. A racing car with passion as the axis and rebellion as the acceleration against the wind, ready to go in the Windy City.

Bamboo Fox has been committed to the development of gasoline-electric hybrid racing cars for many years. In 2020, it changed to the development of VR5 fuel-powered racing cars, and began to study related technologies of VR6 electric racing cars in 2021. Our bigger and far-reaching goal is to bring our achievements to the world. We originally planned to use the VR6 electric racing car to go to the "International Formula Student Racing Competition" in Japan in September this year to pursue our dreams, and to go international to win glory for Taiwan. Due to the new crown pneumonia, Japan's FSAE officially announced that the 2022 event will cancel the qualifications of foreign teams. In the face of the dilemma of lack of funds, we never stop and continue to conceive the blueprint for building a car; in a team with an average age of 21, we never give up and uphold the passion for brave dreams; on the road to the international stage to pursue dreams , we are never slack and need more support from you.

## About VR6

Different from the VR5 fuel truck, the VR6 is designed with the goal of "tram" in response to future trends. VR6 introduced V-model for the first time. First, it established the work assignment, caught the mistakes of the previous generation car, and found out the optimization and improvement plan, and then gradually carried out the process of design goal establishment, specification setting, test adjustment, and final verification. Affected by the epidemic, VR6 encountered financial constraints and delays in processing schedules. The members still kept in touch with manufacturers, and did their best to complete everything from design to processing and final system integration. It is hoped that VR6 will continue the glory of VR5.
